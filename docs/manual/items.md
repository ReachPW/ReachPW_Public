# Items

When items are dropped by monsters or chests, both the item level and magicl level are determine by the area level.

**Area level** is scaled based on game difficulity (normal, nightmare, hell, infero).  In short, the higher the level and game difficulity, the better items you'll receive.

**Item level** determines which items dropped.  This is based on gold vaule.  So cheaper items will drop in lower levels and more expensive items in higher level areas.  Higher levels can drop any item from levels lower than it.

**Magic level** determines both the *chance* and *quality* of magic properties.

**Hints:**
> * Almost all items have unique properties to make them more appealing and playable.
